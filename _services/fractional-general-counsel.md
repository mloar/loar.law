Are you an entrepreneur needing legal advice, but too early-stage to justify a full-time general counsel? I offer an easy monthly subscription service that includes access to my library of continually updated guidance on everything from forming a corporation or LLC to employment agreements to privacy & data protection. Have a question you can't find an answer to? Send me a message through the client portal and I'll get back to you within one business day. A number of additional services such as contract reviews or negotiations with suppliers' or customers' counsel are included or available for a small additional fee.
